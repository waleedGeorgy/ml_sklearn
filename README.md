## Supervised Machine Learning With Scikit-Learn
Implementation of various machine learning algorithms for supervised regression and classification. Namely:
- Linear Regression.
- Multinomial Regression.
- Logistic Regression.
- K-Nearest Neightbour Clustering.
- Support Vector Machines (SVMs).
- Decision Trees.
- Random Forests.
- AdaBoosting.
- Gradient Boosting.
- Naive Bayes.<br />
All this was done along with feature engineering and datasets cleaning and exploration, and using different regularization and cross-validation.<br />
Data exploration and visualization was done using various different types of matplotlib plots and NumPy and Pandas functions.

## Unsupervised Machine Learning With Scikit-Learn
Similar to the above, but using algorithms like:
- K-Means Clustering.
- Hierarchical Clustering.
- DBSCAN.
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA).<br />
In the unsupervised section, model deployment and persistence was also implemented.

Both notebooks contain models that are ready to train and deploy.
