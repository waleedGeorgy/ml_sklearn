# Supervised Machine Learniing With Scikit-Learn
Implementation of various machine learning algorithms for regression and classification. Namely:
- Linear Regression
- Multinomial Regression
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neightbour Clustering
- Support Vector Machines
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- AdaBoosting
- Gradient Boosting
- Naive Bayes<br />
All this was done along with feature engineering and datasets cleaning and exploration.<br />
Data exploration and visualization was done using various different types of matplotlib plots and NumPy and Pandas functions.
